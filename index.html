          <h3>Android Development</h3>
          <p class="skillsP">My first smartphone was an Android, so it made sense sense that I learned to code Android applciations.
                            I started off just creating simple applications to alter features on my phone that I didn't like, such as
                            the contacts app and custom clock widgets.

          <h3>iOS Development</h3>
          <p class="skillsP">After getting a taste of the mobile app space with Android, I was curious to see what iOS had to offer.
                            It's clear to see the power and simplicity iOS contains, especially with creating AR applicaitons. Stay tuned
                            to see my next AR project on my GitHub!

          <h3>Web Development</h3>
          <p class="skillsP">I use the web everyday but have yet to learn the ins and outs of how websites work.
                            So far, I've learned to use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and BootStrap to create content for the web.
                            This website should get better as I learn more new skills!üòâ</p>

          <h3>Photography</h3>
          <p class="skillsP">Photography has been one of my favorite hobbies since I was young, and the last few years it has become
                            a business as well. I specialize in personal shoots and event photography, such as prom, graduation, and parties.
